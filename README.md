Math Notebooks

These notebooks cover a number of basic topics such as linear algebra, basic geometry, etc. I started writing these notebooks when I was helping my kids with middle school and high school (primary and secondary) math homework. Being a good engineer, I hate repeating myself and solving the same problems over and over, so I started working out math homework in Jupyter Notebooks so I wouldn't have to solve every problem from scratch when checking homework.

There are a number of side benefits to doing homework this way: Writing an explanation to a problem in prose is a great way to find out if I understand it, but being able to also code it in the same notebook is next level: I get to also explain it to a computer, and hence I get to validate my prose explanation and at the same time demonstrate how to develop proper coding solutions to simple problems.
